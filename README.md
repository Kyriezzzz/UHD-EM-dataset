# UHD_eyetracking_videos_quality evaluation_dataset
包含眼动数据的超高清视频质量评价库


## Dataset description
The dataset is mainly composed of video information, observer's eye movement information and ultra-high-definition video quality evaluation scores. Building an ultra-high-definition video quality evaluation library including eye movement data can better understand the the physiological and psychological characteristics of watching ultra-high-definition videos. On the other hand, are of great significance to the research on the construction of subjective/objective algorithms for ultra-high-definition video quality.

## Source: UHD videos
There are altogether 4 video sequences in this dataset, which are ultra-high definition video sequences of 4096× 2160/50p /4:2:0 provided by THE TV station of Communication University of China.In addition, each video feed contains UHD video sequences with four quality levels.  

## Result: Eyetracking data
Eye movement data included original view map, region of interest map and basic eye movement parameter data (view coordinates and fixation duration). The original view map was collected by the observer wearing an eye tracker.The region of interest map is a cluster of expert views. 

## Result: Video quality evaluation score
The video quality evaluation score includes subjective evaluation score and objective evaluation score.  Among them, the subjective evaluation score was obtained from the subjective experiment score of 21 observers.The objective evaluation score is derived from the calculation results of the improved algorithm of all-reference objective quality evaluation based on eye movement data
